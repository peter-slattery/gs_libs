// gs_extensions.h and gs_extensions.cpp are both files which contain data structures and
// procedures which make working with multiple gs_libs easier. They facilitate translating
// from one library to another.
//
// You can include the gs_extensions files after all present gs_libs are included and they
// will only load in the functionality relevant to the libs you have included.
// ie if gs_renderer is not included, any functionality relevant to extending the renderer
// will not be included
